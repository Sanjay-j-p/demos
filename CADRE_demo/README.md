Submission Title: CADRE Demo: Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration

# DPackage Description and Purpose

- This package simulates NASAâ€™s CADRE mission, which focuses on mapping the Moon through a trio of autonomous rovers. The simulation is developed using ROS 2 and is part of an open-sourced lunar exploration initiative, slated for Spring 2026.


The package consists of the following:

- Lunar Landscape Design: Created a realistic lunar environment in Blender, based on publicly available NASA Moon images.
- CAD Model Development: Designed the CADRE rover model in SolidWorks and converted it into URDF format for ROS 2 Humble compatibility.
- Simulation & Integration: Integrated the rover with IMU, LRF, and RGB-D sensors for lunar terrain mapping and exploration in Gazebo.
- Teleoperation & Control: Built a Python-based GUI for rover teleoperation, featuring camera visualization and real-time control.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensured simulation compatibility across WSL and VMware Linux for flexible development.

Future Work:

- Implementing reinforcement learning for coordinated mapping and exploration in Gazebo.

More Rovers can be added by using the following modifttcionin main.launch.xml:

```xml
<include file="$(find-pkg-share robot_gazebo)/launch/spawn_with_control.launch.xml">
    <arg name="robot_name" value="robot_#"/>
    <arg name="robot_file" value="robot.xacro"/>
    <arg name="x_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="y_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="z_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="roll_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="pitch_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="yaw_spawn" value="0.0"/>
</include>
```

# How to build and install

To build the docker image and start a docker container follow these passages

1. Clone this repository, change directory to demos\CADRE_demo

2. Run the build script ```./build.sh```

3. Start the container by executing ```./run.sh```

4. (optional) additional terminals can be opened executing ```./open_cmd.sh```

# Run CADRE demo

The CADRE demo can be started by executing the following commands:

Run ```ros2 launch robot_gazebo main.launch.xml``` this launch file will start the gazebo simulator with the Three CADRE rovers in Lunar world.


# Run CADRE GUI teleopration.

In another terminal run ```ros2 run robot_control joy.py``` this will start GUI control for controlling individual Rovers.

# Run CADRE point clouds.

In another terminal run ```ros2 run robot_control mapping.py``` this will start point cloud node and publishes topics.
